This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: incomplete error handling. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API, but only handles errors during the API call itself.  Errors during JSON decoding or subsequent data processing are not caught. The solution, found in `bugSolution.dart`, addresses this by adding more robust error handling within the `try-catch` block and adding specific error handling for `jsonDecode` to handle format exceptions.
